This repo was created by Dr. Christine O'Donnell as a "coding experience" to introduce students to Python programming and cryptography (specifically, using computer code to encrypt and decrypt data via a Caesar cipher). These Jupyter notebooks were originally created for the CompuGirls Hawaii: Cybersecurity program. This relates to the unit on cryptography (specifically, Week 5 in Spring 2021).

The Python-3 Jupyter notebook Files/tools.ipynb contains some behind-the-scenes methods, as well as programming challenges for interested students.
