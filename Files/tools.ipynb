    "Now, let's set up our encryption function. Each letter in the text will be advanced by the `shift` number of letters. For example, if shift is 3, \"a\" will be returned as \"d\", and \"z\" will be returned as \"c\"(since the alphabet will wrap around). This code also preserves if something is upper- or lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain how the code works, the key line is \n",
    "> `new_s = alphabet[(alphabet.index(old_s)+shift) % n_letters]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break it down (following order of operations - same as in math class!):\n",
    "0. `old_s` : This is the letter in the text that we're focusing on now. Note that `old_s` is a variable - it's a placeholder for whatever letter we're looking at. So if text is \"hello\", the first letter is \"h\", and so the variable `old_s` is standing in for that \"h\".\n",
    "1. `alphabet.index(s)` : This looks for where the letter (represented by the variable `old_s`) is in the alphabet. For example, \"h\" is the 8th letter. However, Python begins counting at 0 (so, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,....) instead of 1, so if `old_s` is representing \"h\" (the first letter of \"hello\"), this shift returns 7.\n",
    "2. `alphabet.index(s)+shift` : This adds `shift` to the position of the letter of interest. For example, with the \"h\" and a `shift` of 3, this will return 10.\n",
    "3. `(alphabet.index(s)+shift) % n_letters` : The `%` symbol is the modulo operator, which calculates a remainder. You can Google \"modulo\" to learn more about it. For our purposes, using the modulo operator helps if we're wrapping around the alphabet (e.g., from \"z\" to another letter).\n",
    "4. `alphabet[(alphabet.index(s)+shift) % n_letters]` : This shift now finds the new letter to encrypt our message. So, for \"h\", it'll return \"k\".\n",
    "4. Finally, the function assigns this new letter to the variable `new_s`."

    "* To convert each letter in our text, we use a `for` loop, which goes through each letter in the text string one by one. You can also use this type of statement to loop over items in a list.\n",
    "* This code uses a few `if-else` statements. These are basically creating different cases we handle - (1) is something a letter or another character (e.g., a space or a number), and (2) is the letter upper- or lowercase?\n",
    "* Python works through indentations. If two lines are at the same indent level, they're in the same \"group\", and anything indented further in is depedendent on the preceding line. So, lines 9-20 are all indented within the `for old_s in text` line, which means those lines will be done for each letter in `text`. Similarly, following the `if old_s in alphabet` line, lines 10-17 are indented further in. That means those 7 lines will happen if `old_s` is indeed within `alphabet`, but if that statement isn't true, we'll jump down to line 19 and do the `else`. And, more generally, since everything after line 1 is indented, all of the lines are part of the function `Caesar_encrypt`. If you don't properly indent your code, it will not work as intended.\n",
