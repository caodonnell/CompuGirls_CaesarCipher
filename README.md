A couple Python-3 Jupyter notebooks to create a coding experience for the CompuGirls Hawaii: Cybersecurity program. This relates to the unit on cryptography (specifically, Week 5 in Spring 2020). Students will explore Caesar ciphers as a hands-on way to learn about encrypting and decrypting data. The Python-3 Jupyter notebook Files/tools.ipynb contains some behind-the-scenes methods, as well as programming challenges for interested students.
