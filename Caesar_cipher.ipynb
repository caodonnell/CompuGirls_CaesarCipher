    "1. `alphabet.index(s)` : This looks for where the letter (represented by the variable `old_s`) is in the alphabet. For example, \"h\" is the 8th letter. However, Python begins counting at 0 (so, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,....) instead of 1, so if `old_s` is representing \"h\" (the first letter of \"hello\"), this shift returns 7.\n",

    "3. `(alphabet.index(s)+shift) % n_letters` : The `%` symbol is the modulo operator, which calculates a remainder. You can Google \"modulo\" to learn more about it. For our purposes, using the modulo operator helps if we're wrapping around the alphabet (e.g., from \"z\" to another letter).\n",
